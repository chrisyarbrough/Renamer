## Features
- Rename operations:
  1. Replace base name
  2. Remove a number of characters from start, end or the middle
  3. Change case to upper, lower or title
  4. Search and replace a substring
  5. Regex search and replace
  6. Add a prefix or suffix or insert text at a specific index
  7. Number a sequence with padding
- The window has horizontal and vertical layouts, including an auto-layout based on the window size.
- Rename operations are grouped into basic and advanced categories. Select the mode via the window burger menu.
- The rename action records an undo (scene GameObjects only).
- Operations are applied in order top to bottom and can be reordered via the operation context menu.
- The preview panel shows a before and after for each name. It includes a basic git-like diff view.
